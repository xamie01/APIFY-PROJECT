## Test Scenarios

### 1. Jos applicant

**Response:**

### Summary
- Risk rating: High
- Credit score: 450 (poor)
- Approximate monthly income: ~₦83,333 (based on ₦1M/yr)
- Income profile: Low for large unsecured loans
- Verdict: Likely decline from mainstream banks for a standard personal loan; possible approval from microfinance/fintech for a small amount with stricter terms

### Key risk signals
- Very low credit score suggests high risk (late payments, defaults, or thin file)
- Income appears modest; even small principal amounts can be a large share of monthly cash flow
- Short credit history (age 25); lenders may request proof of employment length, payroll account, and BVN
- No information on current debt obligations; high debt-to-income (DTI) would further reduce eligibility
- No collateral or guarantor information provided

### Approximate capacity benchmarks (rule-of-thumb)
- If you have minimal debt and stable employment, many Nigerian lenders target a total monthly debt service ≤ 30–40% of income.
- With ~₦83k monthly income, that suggests a realistic monthly repayment capacity of roughly ₦25k–₦33k.
- Back-of-the-envelope examples (loans over 12 months at ~30%–35% effective annual rate): 
  - ₦150k → ~₦15k–₦17k/month
  - ₦200k → ~₦20k–₦23k/month
  - ₦300k → ~₦30k–₦35k/month
  - ₦500k → ~₦50k–₦58k/month (likely unaffordable without significantly higher income)

Actual approval depends on the lender’s scoring model, product type, and your full financial profile.

### Evidence you’ll likely need
- Government-issued ID and proof of address
- Bank Verification Number (BVN)
- 3–6 months of bank statements (some accept 1–3 months)
- Employment letter or recent payslips; length of service matters
- Recent utility bill or tenancy agreement
- References/guarantor (if required)

### What to do next
- Decide on a loan amount and purpose (e.g., education, equipment, inventory). A clearly documented need improves approval odds.
- Compare 2–3 lenders: at least one microfinance bank and one fintech (many offer instant decisions online).
- For amounts > ₦200k, consider:
  - A paid guarantor with strong credit and a 2–3x income cushion
  - Asset-backed options if you have collateral
  - A longer tenure to reduce monthly payment
- Keep your debt-to-income ≤ 30% after the loan; overextension invites further score decline.

### Credit score improvement plan (6–12 months).
- Obtain and link a BVN; if eligible, use a secured credit 
 or a “buy now, pay later” product with 0% fees, and repay before the due date every cycle.
- Keep credit utilization < 10–20% of limits; avoid multiple new credit applications within a short window.
- Never miss a payment; set up auto-pay reminders.
- Use fintech products that report to CRC Credit Bureau; dispute and correct any errors on your credit report.
- Increase verifiable income (side income, employer advancement) to strengthen debt service coverage.

Note: This is a general assessment; it isn’t credit counseling, a bank decision, or legal advice. Actual terms depend on lender-specific underwriting. If you share the intended loan amount, purpose, monthly expenses, current debts, employment length, and preferred loan term, I can refine capacity estimates and lender suggestions.

### 2. Northern applicant

**Response:**

### Summary
- Profile: Nigerian male, 45, Kano resident, ₦5M annual income, credit score 760
- First impression: Strong credit profile. Income above median for many local lenders; a 760 score typically suggests very good credit behavior.
- Lagos vs. Kano: Some banks skew approvals to Lagos; in Kano you can still qualify with BVN, TIN/pension payslips, and collateral.
- What matters: Purpose (working capital, equipment, asset purchase), collateral, stable employment (employment vs. self‑employed), existing debt.

### Credit decision (indicative, depends on lender’s policy)
- Likely outcomes: Favorable for unsecured loans up to about ₦1.5–3.0M; larger facilities likely require collateral/guarantee.
- Proposed structures:
  - 1–2 year facility: collateralless or with minimal guarantee
  - 3–5 year facility: with collateral or asset financing
- Pricing: 20–28% effective annual; for collateralized equipment/asset finance, lower tiers (16–22%) may be available. Add a 1–2% processing fee.
- Required security for large requests: Typically title documents for property, assignment of receivables, fixed deposits, or lien over financed assets.

### Capacity snapshot (assumption-based)
- Monthly income: ≈ ₦416,667
- Reasonable debt service cap: 30–35% of income = ~₦125k–₦146k/month
- Indicative borrowing capacity (5-year term):
  - At 20% APR: ~₦4.0–4.5M (based on ~₦125k–₦146k payment)
  - At 28% APR: ~₦3.3–3.8M (for the same payments)
- For any large request, lenders also consider DSCR ~1.2–1.4x; confirm existing obligations.

### Application tips
- Apply via: Commercial bank (Access, GTBank, UBA, FBN, First Bank, Unity Bank), development bank (BOI/BOA), microfinance bank for smaller amounts, fintech lenders (Renmoney, FairMoney, Branch, Carbon) for faster digital decisions.
- Documents: BVN, CAC docs, bank statements (last 3–6 months), employment letter/contract, payslips (last 3), TIN, utility bill for address verification, collateral documents (title search, survey plan, registered title). 
- Rate negotiation: Offer 20–25% if score is verified; shorter tenure and collateral improve pricing.
- Debt consolidation: If you have existing expensive loans, propose consolidation to strengthen affordability.

### Questions to finalize evaluation
- Requested amount and term?
- Purpose and collateral available?
- Current monthly debt payments and debt-to-income ratio?
- Employment status (salaried vs. self-employed) and tenure?
- Acceptable interest rate range and location for servicing?

## Financially Relevant Factors

**Income Analysis:**
- Monthly income: ₦50,000 (~$32 USD equivalent)

- Reasonable credit score suggests payment history
- Government aid is typically consistent

**Concerns:**

- Debt-to-income ratio will be crucial
- Age may affect loan term length

## Recommendation

**Decision depends on:**
1. **Loan amount requested** (should not exceed 30-40% of monthly income for repayment)
2. **Loan purpose** (productive use vs. consumption)
3. **Existing debts** (total obligations)
4. **Collateral availability**
5. **Loan term** (shorter terms preferred given fixed income)

**Likely suitable for:** Small, short-term loans (₦50,000-150,000) with 12-24 month terms
